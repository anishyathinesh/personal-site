      I smell it all in the air: spookiness, magic, and maybe even a little bit of love! Okay, not love, but the others stand true. October, for me, was a month of balance. I've been trying to balance fun and school, and let me tell you, it's not easy. It's been a pain to convince my parents to give me one day of the week where I can run around with my friends. I guess it's in my best interest to go full scholar mode, but I don't have much fun at school these days so I'm trying to make up for it somehow. Why no fun at school, you ask? <br>

      math<br>
      I've got my freshman year math teacher again and I don't see eye to eye with her teaching. I guess it's because it's more "stream of consciousness" style teaching. While I would appreciate and even cherish that in a humanities class, it's not sitting right with me in calculus. I get it, calculus is an abstract math concept so in some way her teaching style makes sense. But it's bad news for those of us who must understand the baseline concepts before moving into theory (those of us=me). I do miss my junior year math teacher since he was direct with the teaching and emphasized structured note taking in class.<br>

      halloween<br>
      Carrie was the goal. I would never say this out loud since it kind of defeats the purpose, but I somewhat identify with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDWzxeo6984" style= "color: white;" >weird girl trope</a>. Maybe not to the Wednesday Addams extreme, more like Alison from The Breakfast Club with a friend or two sprinkled here and there, or maybe more like the absolute baddies from The Craft. So, I thought I would further this feeling by going as Carrie. Of course, silly old me forgot to get the costume together on time, so I just went as stupid Sharon Tate or technically Margot Robbie playing Sharon Tate. Oh my god this is so uninteresting next topic!<br>

      media of the month<br>
      - <i>the handmaiden</i> by park chan-wook. in the same vein as thelma & louise, my favorite movie ever, this movie is just the girls having a good time!! in all seriousness, the plot was so captivating and the movie itself was beautiful to watch. So many hideen details that I'm obsessed with. <br>
      - <i>That's What They All Say</i> by Jack Harlow. Great album that I've been playing on repeat this month. Harlow's rise to fame is so organic and just as likeable as he is. Plus I have a huge crush on him! <br>
      - <i>Gilmore Girls.</i> I've started watching this show, and I finally get the hype... People used to recommend this to me all the time but the first episode seemed so boring that I thought the GG lovers were all delusional or something. Watching this in the fall time really did the trick--very comforting, and that's something I need especially when it gets dark at like 5pm. Wish there were more POC characters, though, but it was a different time... <br>
