    <h1>carefree</h1>

    <p>
      Ever since I began my CS major, I’ve felt like my communication skills have waned. It’s a powerful thing, creating beautiful and concise prose. I want to build up these muscles again, but I also want this to be a lenient space where I can talk about whatever. Hopefully I’l’ find a happy medium. 

Today I want to speak a little about pointlessness. The truth is, I love when activities are a little bit pointless. I love when I can zoom out of what I’m doing a little and think to myself how unimportant it really is in the long term. I’ll probably come back to this and add more, but here are some examples.

Roller rinks
I went to Skate Lovers on Valentine’s weekend and I felt euphoric. I only wiped out one time! Roller skating ma ybe just be rolling around in circles for hours on end, but boy is it fun. They were playing some great tunes as well. When they opened song requests, I asked for Hot in Herre by Nelly. In that moment, I didn’t want to be anywhere else. If tickets to Maui happened to be on the floor, I would skate right on by. At first glance, roller rinks may seems repetitive, but I say that there’s a beauty in it. Not to mention the goofy element of the wheels! We really just decided to put wheels on our shoes and see what would happen.

Madonna songs
This is not to say that madonna is pointless! I think she changed the pop genre forever. I want to diverge from the whole pointless thing right here… I think that pointless has a lot of negative connotations. A better word is carefree. Madonna songs are so carefree!! “Star light, star bright, the star I see tonight…”

Programming
I love coding so much because I’m just making a little machine follow all of my commands. I jus type the right things in the right order and I can make this little guy calculate anything I want, and do all sorts of tricks! When I learn new languages I really feel this, because the whole framework is really just a rulebook that some guy wrote one day. And now I’m learning it so my window can do a flip or whatever. 

Okay, bye!!
